# European Car of the Year - Vote Analysis

### Idea

This is just a mooch around voting patterns in the COTY Award. I just wanted to see if there were any patterns to be seen in the way that jury members vote.

### Data

The data for the project came direct from the COTY [site](http://www.caroftheyear.org/). As the number of pages was small and the formatting irregular I used [importio](https://import.io/) to download the votes rather than coding a web scrape; it worked really well.

### Code and Plots

R statistical software and the RStudio IDE were used to merge the data together and to investigate the patterns. The commented code is included in this repo.

To plot the data, ggplot2 (an R package) was used.
